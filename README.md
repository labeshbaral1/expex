Why Expex?
In the United States, a majority of individuals, approximately 64%, live paycheck to paycheck. Unfortunately, many young adults lack the necessary financial literacy skills, as this topic is not a prominent part of the educational system, leaving them to learn important lessons through trial and error. Expex empowers the next generation of young adults to develop important and sustainable financial habits.
